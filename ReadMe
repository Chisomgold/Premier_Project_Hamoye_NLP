# Final_Project_NLP_Hamoye
This is a collection of all project deliverables for the Premier project in the Hamoye Data Science Winter Internship 2022. 
The project focused on building a model to predict foreign exchange rates based on the available data trends. Foreign exchange dataset was obtained from a Kaggle directory and Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Model building was carried out.
## My roles
I served as the Query Analyst of the project with responsibilities including:
* communication between The Hamoye organizers and my team members
* Organization and coordination of meetings to discuss progress of the project
* Data cleaning and visualization
* Report writing, proofreading and editing
* Presentation editing
## Project Takeaway
It was difficult at first to get people to participate; most people insisted they were beginners and couldn't do much. It takes a persistent and sometimes annoying lead to get things done. On that note, I think I'm interested in more data analysis projects as part of a team. Preferable, something related to health cos all this talk on foreign exchange were not as fascinating as I'd like.
Thank you for coming to my TEDXTalk.
